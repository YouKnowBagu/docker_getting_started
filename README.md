# Completing the Docker getting started guide for future reference

#Summary
I really like Docker, but I believe it is a bit more than I need right now.  Learning about swarms, nodes, and the ins and outs of load balancing was interesting.  That being said, I believe all the work I have been doing learning Docker, Heroku, GAE, AWS, etc. was overkill.  They all offer something unique to the dev ops side of things, but they have distracted me from actually creating any tangible code.  Python's venv or VirtualBox are probably all I really need to test and deploy apps at my current level, and I should be focusing more on building the apps at this point in my career.  Or maybe I just don't get it yet.
